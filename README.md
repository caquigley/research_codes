Codes for PhD research

## Code Description
This code is my active research code for my PhD research. My research is primarily on seismic arrays and their applications to earthquake monitoring efforts. The codes that exist now contain two seperate projects: one for an array of arrays in the Aleutian Islands, AK (https://ds.iris.edu/gmap/#network=9C&starttime=2016-01-01&maxlat=54.2782&maxlon=-165.4387&minlat=53.3245&minlon=-167.614&drawingmode=box&planet=earth); and another for an array of arrays on Kodiak Island and Kachemak Bay, AK.
